**Lab 0: Cubes**

System Overview
==================================
This program uses a file [App.cpp](file:///C:/cs371/0-cubes/build/doc/class_app.html). When initialized, this creates an App object, which is a widget that can display various G3D scene files. I added additional helper methods to App, so that when App is initialized with [App::onInit](file:///C:/cs371/0-cubes/build/doc/class_app.html#a383cf8e8949745f9b2b10651b27d1724) these helpers write text to scene files which can then be viewed. The main two are [generateStaircase](), which generates code for a spiral staircase, and [generateFlowers](file:///C:/cs371/0-cubes/build/doc/class_app.html#a1b8fd6197f5fb0c40f257c4d602c95a1), which generates code for a field of dandelions. The latter one also has three helper methods, [makePuffball](file:///C:/cs371/0-cubes/build/doc/class_app.html#a420f36947fd0caf6c9bca7a59971d30f), [makeBloom](file:///C:/cs371/0-cubes/build/doc/class_app.html#a1524e1bdecd01f7c96a215ccdf423ab3), and [makeStem](file:///C:/cs371/0-cubes/build/doc/class_app.html#a6f834618593dd05632408ffa604937f5), which each return the code to generate one puff, bloom, or stem, which can then help generateFlowers generate the scene file for the complete scene.

First, I created a single instance each of the yellow dandelion in bloom and the white dandelion puff. I created a white cube model for the puff, a yellow rectangular model for the bloom, and a green rectangular prism model for the stems. Then, I created each flower by layering multiple entities of their cubic or rectangular models at different angles. Then, in App.cpp I wrote helper methods that would return a string of the code needed to generate a single puff, bloom, or stem. Then I created another method in App.cpp that generated a scene file for a field of dandelions, which used the helper methods in a for loop, distributing the flowers and stems out from the center, alternating in type.

Questions
==================================
1. The Scene* and shared_ptr<scene> data types differ in that Scene* is a pointer, while shared_ptr<scene> is a shared pointer. If a shared pointer is deleted, it only frees the memory allocated to it if it is the last shared pointer to that memory, while when delete is called on a regular pointer, the memory is freed no matter what.
2. G3D know where to find the scene files. The GApp::Settings object has its data directory set to the current directory. In scene.cpp, setSceneSearchPaths can be used to set the directories that load scene will serach in (defaulting to the current directory, the paths specified by the environment variable, and the directory including scene/CornellBox-Glossy.scn.any).
3. It is more to put one's initialization code in App::onInit rather than in App::App. This is because one does not want to throw an exception in the constructor, before the object actually exists. If one throws an exception from onInit, the exception's value will be returned, providing helpful information, which will not happen for an exception thrown from the constructor.  
4. App::onGraphics3D is called by GApp::onGraphics which is called by GApp::loadScene which is called by App::onInit which is called by GApp::beginRun which is called GApp::onRun which is called by the main;
5. The file cube.obj is stored in g3d\G3D10\build\data\model\cube. When a model is created, a filename is provided. The parser knows where to find that file, because it's in a directory it will search. 
6. A homogenous material might need different colors because each is color represents a different way that light can bounce off said homogenous material.

Reflection
==================================
I learned:

    *The basics of using Visual Studio.

    *How to understand 3D coordinates and rotation.

    *How to use C++ to generate repetitive files.

    *How to use textures.

    *When to rewrite a piece of code rather than continue to debug it.

    *When to use helper methods to make a process more understandable.

    *The basics of using Markdeep.

    *A tiny bit of LaTeX.

Some of this was very specific to our tools, while some was more generally applicable.


Time
==================================
The initial lab period of three hours was spent accimating to visual studio. 
On Sunday, I spent from 12:15 pm to 6:40 pm implementing the cube, spiral staircase, and Cornell Box, and beginning my own scene. Thus, I spent 6 hours and 25 minutes on the lab's required elements. I came back to the lab from 8pm to 10 pm on Sunday to polish and improved my scene, thus spending 2 hours on optional elements. On Monday, I went to the lab to do my report.
