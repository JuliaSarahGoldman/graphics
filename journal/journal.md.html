=====================================================

Rotated white cube 45 degrees by editing white cube code.

Created Cornell box, mainly with trial and error.

Created staircase. Had issues with making sure the most recently generated version of the generated code was being used. This was resolved by delteing old versions of the code under different names.

Created model for dandelion in bloom and dandelion puffballs.

Attempted to generate field of flowers using same technique as stair, but could not debug.

Attempted to write helper methods to generate flowers step by step.

Successfully generated single white flower in this fashion.

readable as plain text but will have additional nice formatting when loaded
in a web browser.

Put the newest entry at the top of this file, like a blog. Begin the title of
each section with a date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).

Press F4 or F6 in your G3D program to automatically add screenshots and video to
