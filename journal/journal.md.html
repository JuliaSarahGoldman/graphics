2016-09-12: Cubes
=============================================================
Arrived 3:15 pm.
Began report.

2016-09-11:
=============================================================

![Ground](2016-09-11_008_0-cubes_r261_g3d_r762__Ground.jpg)
The ground can hold all the flowers.


2016-09-11:
=============================================================

![Added Ground](2016-09-11_007_0-cubes_r261_g3d_r762__Added_Ground.jpg)
I have added ground beneath the flowers.


2016-09-11: 
=============================================================

![Lost petal located](2016-09-11_006_0-cubes_r261_g3d_r762__Lost_petal_located.jpg)
Now flowers have proper number of petals.


2016-09-11:
=============================================================

![Amid the flowers](2016-09-11_005_0-cubes_r261_g3d_r762__Amid_the_flowers.jpg)
Still, I now have a pattern of flowers.

=============================================================

![Created pattern, realized need for additional petal](2016-09-11_004_0-cubes_r248_g3d_r762__Created_pattern__realized_need_for_additional_petal.jpg)

I realized that I was naming one of my petals "stem", thus causing it not to appear.


2016-09-11
=============================================================

![Generated Yellow Flower](2016-09-11_003_0-cubes_r248_g3d_r762__Generated_Yellow_Flower.jpg)
I can now make a field of yellow flowers in place of the white ones.



2016-09-11:
=============================================================

![Created Stems](2016-09-11_002_0-cubes_r248_g3d_r762__Created_Stems.jpg)
Created field of white flowers and added stems.



2016-09-11: Cubes
=============================================================

![Created Row of Flowers](2016-09-11_001_0-cubes_r237_g3d_r762__.jpg)
Created row of white flowers. I now need to make them appear in a grid.


2016-09-11: Cubes
=====================================================
Arrived at lab at 12:15 pm. Took break for dinner at 6:40 pm.
Returned to lab at 8 pm. Left lab at 10 pm.

Rotated white cube 45 degrees by editing white cube code.

Created Cornell box, mainly with trial and error.

Created staircase. Had issues with making sure the most recently generated version of the generated code was being used. This was resolved by delteing old versions of the code under different names.

Created model for dandelion in bloom and dandelion puffballs.

Attempted to generate field of flowers using same technique as stair, but could not debug.

Attempted to write helper methods to generate flowers step by step.

Successfully generated single white flower in this fashion.

2016-09-08: Cubes
=====================================================
Arrived: 1 pm. Left: 4 pm.

Began learning how to use Visual Studio. Have yet to begin implementing actual lab.

2016-08-12: Formatting Notes
=====================================================

This development journal is for you to maintain a log of your project.
It is in [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/) format. It is
readable as plain text but will have additional nice formatting when loaded
in a web browser.

Put the newest entry at the top of this file, like a blog. Begin the title of
each section with a date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).

Press F4 or F6 in your G3D program to automatically add screenshots and video to 
this development journal.
